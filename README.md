# `Ansible with VirtualBox and Vagrant`

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation platform that simplifies the management and deployment of IT systems. It allows you to automate tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration across a wide range of systems, including servers, networking devices, and cloud infrastructure.

Key features of Ansible include:

- Agentless Architecture: Ansible uses SSH or WinRM protocols to connect to remote systems, eliminating the need for installing agents on target machines. This makes it lightweight and easy to set up.

- Declarative Language: Ansible uses YAML to define its configurations, and playbooks. This makes it easy to write, understand, and maintain automation code.
